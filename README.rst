The Analysis Tools package is designed to assist in the creation of quality assurance (QA) plots and metrics from the outputs of an `LSST data reduction pipeline <https://pipelines.lsst.io/modules/lsst.pipe.base/creating-a-pipeline.html>`_.
The intention is that users have the flexibility to construct complex data analysis tasks from a set of simple building blocks.
Each analysis tool allows users to generate consistent, repeatable and high-quality plots and metrics, regardless of which dataset they are run on.

For more information on using the Analysis Tools package, please see the `documentation on pipelines.lsst.io <https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/daily/modules/lsst.analysis.tools/index.html>`_.
As this package is still under active development, it may also be useful to refer to the latest `daily build of the documentation on pipelines.lsst.io <https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/daily/modules/lsst.analysis.tools/index.html>`_ as well.
