r"""This package contains various analysis tools and the PipelineTasks which
run them.

The primary tool in this package is the `AnalysisTool` class.
An `AnalysisTool` class has three stages: prep, process, and produce.
Creating a new `AnalysisTool` involves choosing (through configuration) one or
more `AnalysisAction` classes to run for each of those stages.

Both `AnalysisTool` and `AnalysisAction` are subclasses of the
`~lsst.pex.config.configurableActions.ConfigurableAction` class.
These objects are special types that are configured *prior* to any code
execution, and behave as functions at runtime.
The configuration state of a
`~lsst.pex.config.configurableActions.ConfigurableAction` is saved separately
from the object itself.
